			<h4>What is tidal energy?</h4>
			<p>Tidal energy is a form of green energy that harnesses the natural motion of the tide.
			<h4>Advantages of Tidal Energy</h4>
			<p>Compared with wind, which is intermittent and variable, tidal current energy has some distinct advantages such as high predictability and regularity, which make the exploitation of tidal current energy more attractive. Along those same lines, tidal current energy is compatible with the environment.</p>
			<h4>In-depth analysis</h4>
			<p> Tidal power is non-polluting, reliable and predictable.
Changing tidal flows by damming a bay or estuary could, however, result in negative impacts on aquatic and shoreline ecosystems, as well as navigation and recreation.
Each specific site is different and the impacts depend greatly upon local geography, meaning that solid environmental impact data is almost impossible.
In the Bay of Fundy, tidal power plants could decrease local tides by 15 cm. This does not seem like much when one considers that natural variations such as winds can change the level of the tides by several metres.
The main barrier to increased use of the tides is that of construction costs. There is a high capital cost for a tidal energy project, with possibly a 10-year construction period.</p>
<p>The major factors in determining the cost effectiveness of a tidal power site are the size (length and height) of the barrage required, and the difference in height between high and low tide. These factors can be expressed in what is called a site's "Gibrat" ratio. The Gibrat ratio is the ratio of the length of the barrage in metres to the annual energy production in kilowatt hours (1 kilowatt hour = 1 KWH = 1000 watts used for 1 hour). The smaller the Gibrat site ratio, the more desireable the site. Examples of Gibrat ratios are La Rance at 0.36, Severn at 0.87 and Passamaquoddy in the Bay of Fundy at 0.92.</p>
			<h4>Scientists Try to Asess the Toll of Tidal Systems on Wildlife</h4>
			<p>“Once deployed, marine and wave power technologies change water flow and turbulence, and scientists want to know how these changes impact marine wildlife, namely whether their environment impact is minimal or not.These sonars will give scientists precious info on how fish and birds act around different marine renewable energy devices, and will give them an answer about the possible risk of collision between marine wildlife and installed turbines (tidal power is renewable energy that comes from tidal currents and is generated by using turbines in the tidal flow).Tidal and wave resources have great potential to become important renewable energy sources in years to come. These two sources are predictable and this gives them an important advantage over solar and wind. However, before widely deploying wave and tidal energy technologies it is important to study their environmental impact.”</p>
