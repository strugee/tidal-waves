			<h3>Articles</h3>
			<h4><a href = "http://search.proquest.com">Proquest</a> provides a method to view scholarly articles and research papers. <a href = "http://search.proquest.com/docview/231429770/13DA7EE48D1313C4D2A/1?accountid=2659">This article</a> describes how tidal energy is more or less a constant resource, differentiating it from different sun-derived energies such as wind and solar.</h4>
			<h4>The National Science Foundation, a repudable government site, has <a href = "http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=115965">conducted studies</a> on designing tidal and wave systems.</h4>
			<p>In the building of the of the propeller, the researchers had to work around water resistance as opposed to wind resistance in wind energy. The researchers changed the propeller orientation from horizontal to vertical, allowing direct interaction with the cyclic, up and down motion of wave energy. They also developed individual control systems for each propeller blade, allowing sophisticated manipulations that maximize (or minimize, in the case of storms) interaction with wave energy.</p>

			<h4>The real-world application and efficiency of tidal and wave energy is adressed in <a href = "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148107002340">this article</a> by Science Direct.</h4>
			<p><The ultimate limit of a prospective site to deliver energy is now a topic of some interest and considerable research effort has been extended to investigate just how much energy can be extracted given the appropriate technology. More research will be needed to determine exactly how much energy can be created and used through these methods.</p>
            <p>Although it is likely that every device concept will have its own specific impacts on the flow environment, there will be generic impacts resulting from energy extraction from the water column and the resulting flow distortion. These flow distortions can affect passing sea life and disrupt coral and the sea floor, depending on the location of the device.</p>
            <p>The problem is quite distinct from wind extraction: tidal devices will typically be extracting an appreciable proportion of the kinetic energy flux and will be located relatively close to the upper boundary of the flow environment, the free surface between the water and the air, while wind devices are located near the bottom of a very deep atmospheric layer. These distinct energy sources are both renewable, yet the differences might be part of the reason that wave and tidal energy isn’t being used as much. The propellers for wind power can be weather proofed in a similar way to weatherproofing a house. On the other hand, weatherproofing an underwater propeller presents other challenges, protecting against the salt and any floating debris.</p>
			
			<h4>The difficulty of building deviced that can weather the elements are dicsussed in length by the NSF <a href = "http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/science_nation/waveenergy.jsp">here</a>. </h4>
			<p>The engineers were presented with the challenges of salt water and the roughness of waves. The same constant motion of waves that provides the energy is also continuously battering the hardware that is capturing it. So the engineering challenge is making that hardware strong and simple.</p>
			<p>The actual energy harnessing process as von Jouanne explains, is “a float heaving up and down with the waves. Underneath the float is a magnet assembly, and as that magnet assembly heaves up and down, it creates a changing magnetic field. The coils in the spar experience that changing magnetic field and that induces voltage, and creates electricity."</p>
			
			<h3>Companies</h3>
			<p>This <a href = "http://www.bcsea.org/get-involved/about">British Nonprofit</a> is working to create a sustanable energy future through the use fo tidal and wave energy</p>
			<p><a href = "http://www.openhydro.com/company.html">OpenHydro</a> is a company that works to manufacture renewable tidal turbines. They strive to, "Extract energy from the oceans in an economically viable and environmentally sensitive manner".</p>
